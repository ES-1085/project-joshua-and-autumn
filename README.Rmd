##Write Up
#### Introduction
Pollutants, encompassing metals and organic compounds from agricultural, industrial, and household sources, have accumulated in bottom sediments in the Gulf of Maine. The U.S. federal government, through its agencies (USEPA, USGS, and NOAA) and laws (16 USC § 1447-1447f (1990); 33 USC § 1330 (1987)) has recognized the need for assessment of the distribution of contaminants in marine sediments. Our group is interested in assessing the concentration and distribution of potentially harmful contaminants in the marine environment in order for others to better understand and predict their impact. 

For this project, we used data from the Gulf of Maine Contaminated Sediments Database published by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2002. This dataset is the result of a collaborative effort of several surveys from the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts. Methodology included samples that were collected from the sea floor using a "grab" or "core" method, which were then analyzed for measurements of major and trace elements, organic contaminant compounds, metals, and sediment textural data. 


#### Missing Data and Skewness
While working with this dataset, we noticed that there was a number of missing values for


#### Summary and Findings of Contaminates and Concentrations
The broad question that we looked at was about which contaminants are in the Gulf of Maine and what this means for the environment. 

## Navigating the Project Folder
There are a series of subfolders that are contained within this project, including RMD, MD, and .shapefiles. 

For the data dictionary, navigate to the `Readme.md` file in the `data` folder. This contains what each dataset contains, as well as what each variable represents. 

To begin analyzing the data, navigate to the `data_tidying.rmd` in the `analysis` folder. This contains the code that is needed to clean and pivot the USGS datasets into readable formats. These cleaned files are the base files for the next .Rmd files. 

For PCB analysis, navigate to the `PCBs.rmd` in the `analysis` folder.  

For PAH analysis, navigate to the `PAHs.rmd` in the `analysis` folder. This .Rmd file analyzes the distributions and concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants

## Acknowledgements
We are incredibly grateful for the agencies and organizations in the Gulf of Maine area who provided this data in published reports, theses, unpublished data, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Status and Trends Benthic Surveillance program, NOAA, and  U.S. Geological Survey. This includes the individuals who participated in the collection, interpretation, and compilation of these datasets, including but not limited to M. Buchholtz ten Brink, F. Manheim, E. Mecray, M. Hastings, J. Currence, J. Farrington, B. Tripp, S. Jones, P. Larsen, G. Wallace, and L. Ward. We give our thanks to the Gulf of Maine Regional Marine Research Program for funding their project. Finally, we are eternally grateful for Dr. Laurie Baker, who provided us the instruction, guidance and advice necessary for us to enhance our understanding of R and data reliability, as well as the importance of team collaboration. 

## Data 
#### Data Summary
Our data came from the Gulf of Maine Contaminated Sediments Database published by the U.S. Geological Survey in their Open-File Report 02-403. The full citation list for sources of data that was entered into the Contaminated Sediments Database for the Gulf of Maine can be found here: https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-403/HTMLdocs/entdocs.html. The Database of Contaminated Sediments for the Gulf of Maine is a carefully compiled collection of edited data on contaminated sediments and associated properties, sourced from diverse outlets. The data was reviewed for quality, standardized by format, and integrated into a regional database. The resulting database includes original data from various sources and includes documentation regarding data quality. Its purpose is to assess the environmental status of coastal sediments, understand contaminant transport paths, and determine the fate of pollutants in the region.
