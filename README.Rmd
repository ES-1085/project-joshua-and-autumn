## Introduction
Pollutants, encompassing metals and organic compounds from agricultural, industrial, and household sources, have accumulated in bottom sediments in the Gulf of Maine. The U.S. federal government, through its agencies (USEPA, USGS, and NOAA) and laws (16 USC § 1447-1447f (1990); 33 USC § 1330 (1987)) has recognized the need for assessment of the distribution of contaminants in marine sediments. Our group is interested in assessing the concentration and distribution of potentially harmful contaminants in the marine environment in order for others to better understand and predict their impact. 

For this project, we used data from the Gulf of Maine Contaminated Sediments Database published by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2002. This dataset is the result of a collaborative effort of several surveys from the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts. Methodology included samples that were collected from the sea floor using a "grab" or "core" method, which were then analyzed for measurements of major and trace elements, organic contaminant compounds, metals, and sediment textural data.

Write-up of your project and findings go here. 
Think of this as the text of your presentation. 
The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read out loud.
Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750 words. 
To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count the words of (probably this is the 
Summary section of this document, go to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin).
This addin counts words using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as long as you're in the ballpark of 750 words, you're good! 
The addin will ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results / plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). 
And make sure to hide your code with  `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to make is about the code itself.
Your results with proper output and graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of your project.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE}
# load data here, if you like
```

## Data 
Our data came from the Gulf of Maine Contaminated Sediments Database published by the U.S. Geological Survey in their Open-File Report 02-403. The full citation list for sources of data that was entered into the Contaminated Sediments Database for the Gulf of Maine can be found here: https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-403/HTMLdocs/entdocs.html. The Database of Contaminated Sediments for the Gulf of Maine is a carefully compiled collection of edited data on contaminated sediments and associated properties, sourced from diverse outlets. The data was reviewed for quality, standardized by format, and integrated into a regional database. The resulting database includes original data from various sources and includes documentation regarding data quality. Its purpose is to assess the environmental status of coastal sediments, understand contaminant transport paths, and determine the fate of pollutants in the region.
